# ToDoApp_Django

This is a small To Do App I built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to practise my web developing skills.

## Prerequisites:
* PostgreSQL
  * you will need a database with name and user/password as configured in `ToDoApp/settings.py`
* python3
* Django

## Project Setup

### Run migrations
```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Run the app!

Now go to http://localhost:8000 and start browsing :)
